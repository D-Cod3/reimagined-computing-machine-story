Once upon a time there was an ogre who lived in a swamp. His name was Shrek. Shrek was an unruly beast who loved his swamp. One day he met a donkey named Donkey by acidentially saving his life from the kings gaurds. Donkey was a donkey who had gained the ability to speak through some magic gone wrong. The kingsgaurd found this fascinating and wanted to bring Donkey back to the king to be his jester. Donkey tried running away and was eventually saved from the kingsgaurd by Shrek.

Donkey, having no friends, decides to follow Shrek back to the swamp. Shrek, who hates having company, found Donkey to be very annoying and asked him to shut up constantly. Shrek finally returns home, but later that night, he finds out that the king has made his swamp a place for exiles. This angers him, and he decides to confront the king at his castle. He reluctantly takes donkey on his journey, as Donkey was the only one that was willing to show Shrek where the castle was. The two set off on their journey.

One day, when they are on their way to the castle, they are found by the kings gaurds in a forest. Sherk is strong enough to win that fight but there are more kings guards coming when they are fighting. Sherk is dying, but at that moment, Donkey starts to takes Sherk runs away. Because Donkey lived in this forest before, he knows this forest really well. Finally, they ran away.
