Once upon a time there was an ogre who lived in a swamp. His name was Shrek. Shrek was an unruly beast who loved his swamp. One day he met a donkey named Donkey by acidentially saving his life from the kings gaurds. Donkey was a donkey who had gained the ability to speak through some magic gone wrong. The kingsgaurd found this fascinating and wanted to bring Donkey back to the king to be his jester. Donkey tried running away and was eventually saved from the kingsgaurd by Shrek.
